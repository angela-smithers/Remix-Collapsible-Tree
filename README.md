# D3.js-Collapsible-Tree
Just a simple derived D3.js Collapsible Tree library. This script enables developers to instantiate one or more tree's capable of performing the following operations:
* Generate / Destroy Tree;
* Style some *SVG* elements through *CSS*;
* Enable Zoom;
* Node Selection;
* Node click Callbacks;
* Lazy Loading (*Ajax* requets);
* Two kinds of Node toggling;


This was used as a module for a web App on a personal project. Feel free to use / study / change / contribute :)

**Disclaimer:** This is a D3-based library. I do not own or have any affliation with D3.js, nor do I intend to promote any material for any personal cause / benefit.
